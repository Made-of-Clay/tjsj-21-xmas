        <h2>Tree</h2>
        <p>
          Greco-Roman and Germanic rites used winter evergreens to signify life enduring darkness (i.e. remaining green during the dead of winter).
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern Christmas tree tradition began in 16th-century Germany, popularized by Martin Luther. It spread through Europe and North America in the 18th &amp; 19th centuries.
        </p>
        <p>Wreaths similarly represent life in the winter, and also symbolize the cyclical nature of time &amp; the promise of renewal.</p>
      </section>

      <section data-shot="nativity">
        <h2>Nativity</h2>
        <p>
          Nativities are direct representations of the birth narratives found in the Gospels of Matthew &amp; Luke and are <strong>arguably the most iconic element of Christmas</strong> given its historic roots.
          Nativities were non-verbal depictions intended to make the Scripture accessible &amp; inspire devotion among the laity (illiterate).
        </p>
        <p>
          Francis of Assisi's 1223 Greccio celebration is the first key reference for live tableaux.

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hand-crafted Nativity sets evolved into common household devotionals in Catholic Europe. Now nativities are commonplace in Christian homes worldwide during the Christmas season.

      <section data-shot="star">
        <h2>Star</h2>
        <p>
          The star derives from Matthew's Gospel as the celestial sign guiding the Magi. It commonly tops evergreen Christmas trees in modern traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been depicted historically as a single bright star, but some other explanations include a comet or  planetary conjunction. Angels are also sometimes referred to as stars in biblical poetry (Job 38:7; Isaiah 14:13; Revelation 1:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christmas star theologically represents divine guidance &amp; the visual shorthand for the Incarnation.

      <section data-shot="gifts">
        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          Gift-giving is anchored in the biblical Magi bringing gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Traditions of Santa Claus giving gifts to children are inspired by St. Nicholas of Myra, a 4th-century bishop known for his generosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-christian traditions like Saturnalia &amp; Yule were blended into Christmas gift-giving customs. This helped preserve practices compatible with Christian theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tradition was solidified in the 19th century into a child-focused family gift exchange.

      <section data-shot="lights">
        <h2>Lights</h2>
        <p>
          Candles and fires at midwinter long predate Christianity pointing towards the sun's return. Christianity interprets them as signs of Christ: "Light of the World."
        </p>
        <p>
          Tree candles and window lights developed in early-modern German Protestant homes. Electric lights later allowed this symbol to become widespread and safe.
        </p>

      <section data-shot="santa">
        <h2>Santa</h2>
        <p>
          St. Nicholas of Myra (4th century) is the source of the Santa Claus figure. Known for his generosity, he inspired gift-giving traditions during Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholas eventually merged (conceptually) with Dutch-American "Sinterklaas" and European gift-bringer folklore. 19th-20th-century media later established the secular, red-suited North Pole figure.
